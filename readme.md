# Proview
This project aims to recreate Echo. I've been using Echo for a long time, but since it isn't supported as an app on Android, I've decided to go one step further. I'm creating a website that is fully optimized for web use or can function as a service worker. This allows it to be installed on your device's home screen and operate like a standard app.

## What does it contain?
- Convert grades to a percentage format (e.g., "100%") for clearer understanding, moving away from the standard "6 out of 6 standards."
- Provide easier access to agendas, to-dos, and activities.
- Include a gradebook feature, which is not available in Echo viewer.
- Introduce announcements, a feature missing in Echo viewer.
- Add user settings options, expanding beyond the capabilities of Echo viewer.
- Offer general help resources, such as popup tips or comprehensive documentation to address questions or concerns.

## Bugs/Implementations

# Enjoy
I have to say it: I believe I will make a more significant impact on Echo with this project, even if my code isn't perfect. It will demonstrate my ideas for improving Echo, and perhaps, just maybe, they will notice and implement these changes.
