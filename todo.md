# Todo
Created so that I don't forget some of the things that need to (happen / be fixed).

<br>

# Implement
- Courses (shows courses from echo) (add course pages)
- Stream (shows any activity from teachers and you (optionally))
- Todo (shows current work that is going to be due, unlike echo this will look for ANYTHING that has a due date)
- ~~Averages (undecided if this is what i will call it, but it will show your averages from standards e.g: agency, collab, etc)~~
- * Averages will be shown in Grades
- Contact teachers 
- Settings page settings (lets you configure the website to your liking)
- Change name & Change profile picture (settings page)
- ~~Add `Hide Courses` to continue work on `Courses`~~


# Fix
- ~~Announcements currently doesn't show a loading overlay when you click onto an ongoing announcement.~~
- ~~Navigation header buttons need to be spaced from the top and bottom so that mobile users can click it easily.~~
- ~~(maybe) redo the announcements reload feature so that it doesn't do it by reloading the page, and instead fetchs the stuff again.~~
- ~~Container followed custom screen sizes from `tailwind.config`~~
- ~~Never thought about the title having a "-" so i made it space that and handle the second word~~
